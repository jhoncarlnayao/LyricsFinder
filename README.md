Spotify Song Lyric Finder 🎵
A simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to search for song lyrics. Since Spotify doesn’t provide lyrics through its API, this tool fetches lyrics from third-party sources like the Lyrics.ovh API and Lyrist API as a backup.

Features ✨
✅ Search for lyrics by entering a song name and artist name
✅ Displays lyrics in a popup window
✅ Uses multiple API sources to improve accuracy
✅ Minimalistic UI with a smooth user experience

How It Works 🔍
Enter the song name and artist name in the input fields
Click Find Lyrics to search for the lyrics
The app fetches lyrics from Lyrics.ovh first
If unavailable, it tries fetching from Lyrist API
The lyrics are displayed in a popup window
Technologies Used 🛠
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (No frameworks)
Fetch API for retrieving lyrics
Google Fonts for typography
This project is lightweight and easy to use. Give it a try! 🚀
